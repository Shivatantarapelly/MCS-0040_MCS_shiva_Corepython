Database:
A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, stored
in our local system.Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them,
are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

DBMS:

Database Management Systems (DBMS) are used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.
A DBMS serves as an interface between an end-user and a database, allowing users to create, read, update,
and delete data in the database.

DBMS manage the data, the database engine, and the database schema, allowing for data to be manipulated
or extracted by users and other programs. This helps provide data security, data integrity, concurrency,
and uniform data administration procedures.
