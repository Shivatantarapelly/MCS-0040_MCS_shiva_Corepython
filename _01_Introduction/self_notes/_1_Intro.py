'''Python is a high level, cross platform and open sourced programming language.
Guido van Rossum began working in python in the late 80's as a successor to abc programming language and
first released in 1991 as python0.9.0 and python 2.0 was released in 2000 with new features such as list
comprehension and garbage collection system using reference counting. and later python 3 was released in 2008
and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible. python2 was dicontinued
in 2020 and last version is 2.7.18.

#Python Features
'''
1. Python is an interpreter based language, which allows execution of one instruction at a time.
2. Extensive basic data types are supported e.g., numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long 
   integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.
2. Variables can be strongly typed as well as dynamically typed.
3. Supports object-oriented programming concepts such as class, inheritance, objects, module, namespace etc.
4. Cleaner exception handling support.
5. Supports automatic memory management.
6. Various built-in and third-party modules, which can be imported and used independently in the Python application

#python advantages:
'''
1. Easy to learn and easy to use
    as the syntax is similar to english language and there is no concern of {},; etc like in java,c,c++
2. Python is an open source programming language
3. Python is a cross platform language. it works on different os platforms windows, linux, macos
4. it is an extendable language.additional fuctionality and be made available through modules and packages 
   written in other language.
5. python can be integrated with other popular programming technologies like c,c++, java 
'''

#where we can use python
'''
1. Data science: today the python has became the language of choice for data scientist. python libraries like 
   numpy, pandas, matplotlib are extensively used in the process of data analysis.
2. Machine learning: in this we use python libraries such as Scikit learn, tensorflow and nltk for real world 
   scenarios like medical diagnosis , sales prediction etc
3. Web development: web frame works like django, flask, pyramid etc make it very easy to develop, deploy 
   easy as well as complex web application.
4. Image Processing: open cv library is commonly used for face recognition etc
5. Game development: pygame library is extensively used for building games for the desktop and mobile platforms.
6. other areas embedded systems and IoT ,Adroid apps, Automated jobs , rapid development tool.
