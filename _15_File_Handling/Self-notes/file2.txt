We can also split lines using file handling in Python. This splits the variable when space is encountered.
You can also split using any characters as we wish. Here is the code:

# Python code to illustrate split() function
with open("file.text", "r") as file:
    data = file.readlines()
    for line in data:
        word = line.split()
        print (word)
