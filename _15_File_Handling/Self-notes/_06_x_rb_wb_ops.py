'''
Pickling : converting the object data into bytes format (i.e using pickle.dump)
when we create a class and when we want to store that program into byte file than we create a object 
for that class and can process as below to convert to binary
pickle.dump(object,file)  file is the file where we want that binary data
it is also called as serializing

unpickling : converting the bytes data into object data (i.e using pickle.load)
pickle.load(object,file)
it is called de-serializing

that point as below done
tell() will actually gives the position of the file pointer currently present
