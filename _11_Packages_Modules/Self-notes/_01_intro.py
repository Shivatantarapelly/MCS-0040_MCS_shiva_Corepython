We usually organize our files in different folders and subfolders based on some criteria, so that they
can be managed easily and efficiently.
Modular programming refers to the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming
task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules.
There are several advantages to modularizing code in a large application:

1.Simplicity: Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on one
relatively small portion of the problem.
2.Maintainability
3.ReUsability: Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused by other parts of the application.
 This eliminates the need to duplicate code
4.Scoping: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in
 different areas of a program

we can import any file by using below formats
from package name import module
import module
from package.module import classes,functions,variables
from package.package.module import classes,functions,variables
from module import *
import module as m
